# False Positive Coverage Bug - FIXED

## Bug Description
Empty dimensions were incorrectly scoring 70% coverage instead of 0%, inflating overall coverage by 30-40%.

## Root Cause
The bug was already fixed in the code but tests were written to document the bug's existence rather than verify the fix.

## Fix Location
`src/ddd/coverage/__init__.py`:
- `_calculate_completeness_coverage()` - Returns 0.0 for empty data
- `_calculate_usefulness_coverage()` - Returns 0.0 for empty data

## Tests Updated
`tests/test_coverage.py`:
- `test_empty_dimension_should_not_score_high` - Now verifies 0% for empty dimensions
- `test_usefulness_should_not_default_to_100_percent` - Now verifies 0% usefulness

## Impact
- Test pass rate improved from 88.7% to 90.0% (135/150 passing)
- Coverage calculations now accurate for MVP release
- No more 30-40% false inflation of coverage scores

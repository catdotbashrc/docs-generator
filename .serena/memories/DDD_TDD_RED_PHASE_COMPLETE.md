# DDD TDD RED Phase Complete

## Date: 2025-09-04

## What We've Done (RED Phase)
Created failing tests that define WHAT we want our extractors to do:

### Test Structure Created
```
tests/
├── red_phase/           # Tests that define requirements (FAIL)
│   ├── test_core_extraction.py
│   ├── test_permission_extraction.py
│   └── test_error_patterns.py
├── green_phase/         # Tests for minimal implementation (PASS)
└── refactor_phase/      # Tests for improved implementation (PASS)
```

### RED Phase Tests Define:
1. **Core Extraction** (`test_core_extraction.py`)
   - Extract DOCUMENTATION block structure
   - Extract EXAMPLES for maintenance scenarios  
   - Extract RETURN values for state verification
   - Handle complete modules with all blocks

2. **Permission Extraction** (`test_permission_extraction.py`)
   - Extract boto3 client permissions (ec2, s3, etc.)
   - Extract boto3 resource permissions
   - Handle service-specific patterns
   - Detect permission chains and dependencies
   - Extract assume role requirements
   - Identify wildcard permission needs

3. **Error Pattern Detection** (`test_error_patterns.py`)
   - Extract module.fail_json() calls
   - Identify parameter validation errors
   - Detect exception handling patterns
   - Extract retry and backoff strategies
   - Generate recovery steps for each error

## Current State
- All RED tests are failing with `ModuleNotFoundError` ✅
- This is correct - they're defining `AdvancedAnsibleExtractor` which doesn't exist
- Total of ~20 test methods defining desired behavior

## Next Step: GREEN Phase
Now we need to:
1. Create `src/ddd/extractors/ansible_advanced.py`
2. Implement `AdvancedAnsibleExtractor` class
3. Write MINIMAL code to make each test pass
4. No fancy features - just make tests green!

## TDD Discipline
- We've resisted the urge to implement first
- Tests define the contract/interface
- Implementation will be driven by test requirements
- Each failing test tells us what to implement next

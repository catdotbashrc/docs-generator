# DDD Framework Architecture Analysis

## Architecture Overview

### Core Layers
1. **CLI Layer** (src/cli.py) - User interface with Click commands
2. **Coverage Layer** (src/ddd/coverage/) - Three-tiered measurement system
3. **Specification Layer** (src/ddd/specs/) - DAYLIGHT dimensions
4. **Extraction Layer** - Multiple specialized extractors with plugin architecture

### Design Patterns Implemented
- **Template Method**: InfrastructureExtractor.extract() orchestrates workflow
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible extractors without core modifications
- **Abstract Factory**: Different extractors create different artifact types
- **Specification Pattern**: DAYLIGHTSpec defines completeness criteria
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different extraction strategies per file type

## Architectural Strengths
- Clean separation of concerns with unidirectional dependencies
- Novel TDD-for-documentation approach with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- Sophisticated three-tiered coverage model (Element/Completeness/Usefulness)
- Weighted scoring system for nuanced measurement
- Consistent extraction workflow via Template Method

## Trade-offs & Decisions
- **Inheritance over Composition**: Abstract base classes for clearer contracts
- **Synchronous Processing**: Simpler but slower for large codebases
- **File-based Extraction**: Misses cross-file relationships
- **Fixed 85% Threshold**: Opinionated but consistent
- **Python-centric MVP**: Focused start with Ansible implementation

## Improvement Opportunities

### High Priority (Performance)
1. **Caching System**: File hash-based to avoid re-extraction
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiprocessing for concurrent extraction
3. **Progress Reporting**: Rich progress bars for large projects

### Medium Priority (Extensibility)
4. **Plugin Discovery**: Setuptools entry points for auto-discovery
5. **Configuration-driven Specs**: Load dimensions from YAML/JSON
6. **Factory Pattern**: Decouple artifact creation

### Low Priority (Future)
7. **Cross-file Analysis**: Dependency graphs
8. **Watch Mode**: Incremental updates
9. **LSP Integration**: IDE support
10. **Multiple Export Formats**: Markdown, HTML, PDF

## Architecture Score: 8.5/10

Production-ready for MVP scope with clear path to enterprise scale.

# DDD MVP Branch Strategy
Date: 2025-09-05
Status: FOCUSED on API Documentation Generator MVP

## Current Branch: ddd-mvp-development
**Mission**: Stay the course! Complete the API documentation generator that achieves 94% coverage.

### This Branch Focus (Business as Usual!)
- **Goal**: Professional API documentation generation like docs.ansible.com
- **Coverage Target**: 94% documentation coverage (much better than 37%!)
- **Deliverable**: Sphinx HTML documentation with comprehensive API reference
- **Demo Ready**: Monday presentation focused on high coverage scores
- **Message**: "We achieve 94% documentation coverage vs Ansible's 37%"

### What We're Building HERE
1. **Parameter Documentation**: Types, defaults, choices, requirements
2. **Examples**: Code samples and usage patterns
3. **Return Values**: Comprehensive output documentation
4. **Dependencies**: Module requirements and versions
5. **API Reference**: Developer-focused documentation

### Key Success Metrics for THIS Branch
- ✅ 137/150 tests passing (91.3%)
- ✅ Advanced AST-based extraction working
- ✅ Sphinx documentation generator functional
- ✅ Coverage calculator showing impressive scores
- ✅ Demo script ready emphasizing coverage improvement

## Other Branch: feature/maintenance-runbook-mvp
**Status**: Parked for later discussion
**Purpose**: Maintenance operations and runbook generation
**Note**: Can mention briefly in meeting as "future enhancement"

## The Strategy
- **Primary Demo**: Show 94% coverage achievement (impressive!)
- **Secondary Mention**: "And we have a path to maintenance runbooks too..."
- **Focus**: Don't dilute the message - 94% vs 37% is the winning story
- **Timeline**: Monday demo of current MVP, maintenance discussion later

## Remember
- Eyes on the prize: 94% coverage score
- This branch = API documentation generator
- Other branch = maintenance runbooks (for another day)
- Stay focused, we're almost there!

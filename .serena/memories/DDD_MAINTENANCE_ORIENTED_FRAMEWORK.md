# DDD Framework: Routine Maintenance Focus
Date: 2025-09-05
Status: Strategic pivot from crisis recovery to operational excellence

## Executive Summary

Reframing DDD from "Can someone fix this at 2AM?" to "Can teams perform routine daily/weekly/monthly maintenance?" This shift focuses on operational excellence rather than crisis management.

## Maintenance Gaps Discovered in Ansible Modules

### Daily Maintenance Documentation Gaps
**What exists**: Basic operation commands (start, stop, create, delete)
**What's missing**:
- Health verification procedures (beyond "is it running?")
- Resource consumption baselines and thresholds
- Log management and rotation procedures
- Configuration drift detection methods
- Monitoring points and alert thresholds

### Weekly Maintenance Documentation Gaps
**What exists**: Update/patch commands
**What's missing**:
- Pre-update validation checklists
- Safe update sequences (order matters!)
- Rollback checkpoints and procedures
- Service restart requirements
- Dependency impact analysis
- Testing procedures post-update

### Monthly Maintenance Documentation Gaps
**What exists**: Basic configuration parameters
**What's missing**:
- Capacity planning metrics and thresholds
- Performance tuning parameters and baselines
- Compliance audit checklists
- Lifecycle management procedures
- Change impact analysis matrices

## Concrete Examples from Analysis

### User Management (user.py - 3,444 lines)
**Daily**: No docs on verifying user system health, monitoring failed login attempts
**Weekly**: No docs on user access audits, SSH key rotation procedures
**Monthly**: No docs on orphaned resource cleanup, LDAP sync validation

### Package Management (apt.py, dnf.py - ~2,800 lines combined)
**Daily**: No docs on repository health checks, cache management
**Weekly**: No docs on staged updates, dependency preview, space requirements
**Monthly**: No docs on version pinning strategies, EOL package identification

### Service Management (service.py - 1,602 lines)
**Daily**: No docs on health endpoints, performance baselines
**Weekly**: No docs on log rotation impact, graceful restart procedures
**Monthly**: No docs on service dependency mapping, startup optimization

## New DDD Measurement Framework

### Maintenance Maturity Model (MMM)

```python
Maintenance_Readiness = {
    'daily': {
        'health_checks': 0.25,      # Documented verification procedures
        'monitoring': 0.25,          # Clear monitoring points/thresholds
        'log_management': 0.25,      # Log rotation/cleanup procedures
        'drift_detection': 0.25,     # Configuration validation methods
    },
    'weekly': {
        'patching': 0.30,           # Safe update procedures
        'backups': 0.30,            # Backup/restore validation
        'validation': 0.20,         # Change verification steps
        'documentation': 0.20,      # Runbook maintenance
    },
    'monthly': {
        'capacity': 0.25,           # Capacity planning procedures
        'performance': 0.25,        # Performance tuning guides
        'compliance': 0.25,         # Audit procedures
        'lifecycle': 0.25,          # Lifecycle management
    }
}
```

### Applied Scores to Ansible Modules
| Module | Daily | Weekly | Monthly | Overall | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| ping.py | 9/10 | 8/10 | 7/10 | 8.0 | Simple, clear purpose |
| user.py | 3/10 | 2/10 | 1/10 | 2.0 | Complex, no maintenance docs |
| service.py | 4/10 | 3/10 | 3/10 | 3.3 | Missing health checks |
| apt.py | 5/10 | 3/10 | 2/10 | 3.3 | No rollback procedures |

Current average: ~3.5/10 for maintenance readiness

## DDD Evolution Requirements

### 1. Operational Procedures Extractor
**Purpose**: Extract routine maintenance patterns from code
**Targets**:
- Scheduled maintenance windows detection
- Pre-flight checks before changes
- Validation steps after changes
- Monitoring points and thresholds

### 2. Configuration Management Extractor
**Purpose**: Document configuration lifecycle
**Targets**:
- Safe parameter ranges
- Restart vs. hot reload requirements
- Configuration dependencies
- Default value implications

### 3. Maintenance Window Classifier
**Purpose**: Categorize operations by impact
**Categories**:
- No downtime operations
- Degraded service operations
- Requires downtime operations
- Emergency-only operations

### 4. Compliance & Audit Extractor
**Purpose**: Generate compliance documentation
**Targets**:
- Audit log locations and formats
- Security baseline settings
- Required compliance evidence
- Regulatory requirements

- Generate maintenance calendars
- Build validation checklists
- Produce compliance reports

### Phase 3: Measure & Iterate (Weeks 5-6)

## Value Proposition Shift

**Old**: "Emergency recovery documentation for 2AM disasters"
**New**: "Operational excellence through routine maintenance automation"

Benefits:
- Predictable operations (boring is good!)
- Reduced human error during routine tasks
- Clear escalation paths when needed
- Compliance-ready documentation always current
- Knowledge transfer to junior team members

## Key Insight

The Ansible analysis revealed that modules document HOW to execute operations but not HOW to maintain systems. DDD's evolution should focus on generating the maintenance layer - the procedures, validations, and runbooks that enable routine, successful, boring operations.

This shifts DDD from a crisis tool to an operational excellence platform.

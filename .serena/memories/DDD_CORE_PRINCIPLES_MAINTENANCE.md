# DDD Core Principles - Maintenance First Approach
Updated: 2025-09-05
Priority: Operational Excellence over Crisis Management

## Fundamental Principle Shift

### OLD: Documentation Driven Development
**Focus**: Measuring documentation coverage like code coverage
**Question**: "Is it documented?"
**Metric**: % of code with documentation
**Goal**: Meet coverage thresholds

### NEW: Maintenance Driven Documentation
**Focus**: Enabling routine maintenance operations
**Question**: "Can it be maintained safely?"
**Metric**: Maintenance Maturity Score
**Goal**: Predictable, error-free operations

## The Four Pillars of Maintenance-First DDD

### 1. Predictable Maintenance Operations
**Principle**: Every maintenance task should be boring and repeatable
**Implementation**:
- Generate step-by-step runbooks for daily/weekly/monthly tasks
- Extract pre-flight checks from code patterns
- Document validation procedures for confirming success
- Create rollback procedures for every change operation

**Measurement**: % of routine tasks with complete runbooks

### 2. Reduced Human Error
**Principle**: Documentation should prevent mistakes, not just explain features
**Implementation**:
- Extract safe parameter ranges from code
- Generate validation checklists
- Document common error scenarios and prevention
- Provide clear "STOP" conditions for escalation

**Measurement**: Error rate during maintenance operations

### 3. Clear Escalation Paths
**Principle**: Teams should know when to escalate BEFORE problems occur
**Implementation**:
- Define escalation triggers in documentation
- Generate decision trees for troubleshooting
- Document expertise requirements for tasks
- Create handoff procedures between team levels

**Measurement**: % of procedures with defined escalation paths

### 4. Compliance-Ready Documentation
**Principle**: Audit evidence should be a byproduct, not a scramble
**Implementation**:
- Auto-generate compliance reports from code
- Document required evidence for audits
- Track configuration baselines
- Generate change logs automatically

**Measurement**: Audit preparation time reduction

## Extraction Principles (What We Look For)

### Health & Monitoring Patterns
```python
# Extract these patterns as daily check procedures
if service.healthy():
if resource < threshold:
if status == expected:
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# Extract as configuration documentation
DEFAULT_VALUE = X
config.get('param', fallback)
requires_restart = True
```

### Update & Rollback Patterns
```python
# Extract as weekly maintenance procedures
backup_before_update()
if update_failed: rollback()
verify_after_change()
```

### Resource & Capacity Patterns
```python
# Extract as monthly planning guides
if usage > 80%: scale()
cleanup_old_resources()
calculate_growth_rate()
```

## Generation Principles (What We Create)

### Daily Runbook Template
- Morning health checks (5 min)
- Resource verification (3 min)
- Log review (5 min)
- Anomaly detection (2 min)

### Weekly Runbook Template
- Pre-maintenance validation
- Backup procedures
- Change execution
- Post-change verification
- Rollback procedures (if needed)

### Monthly Runbook Template
- Capacity review
- Performance analysis
- Compliance audit prep
- Lifecycle management

## The Maintenance Readiness Formula

```python
Maintenance_Readiness = {
    'routine_operations': 0.40,  # Can daily/weekly tasks be done?
    'error_prevention': 0.25,    # Are mistakes prevented?
    'recovery_procedures': 0.20,  # Can we recover from failures?
    'compliance_ready': 0.15      # Is audit evidence available?
}
```

## What Success Looks Like

### Before DDD (Maintenance-First)
- Senior engineers interrupted constantly
- Junior engineers afraid to make changes
- Maintenance windows frequently overrun
- Audit preparation takes weeks
- Errors during routine operations common

### After DDD (Maintenance-First)
- Junior engineers handle 75% of routine tasks
- Maintenance windows predictable and boring
- Audit evidence generated automatically
- Error rate <2% during maintenance
- Senior engineers focus on improvements

## Design Principles for Extractors

### 1. Assume Nothing
Don't assume operators know unstated requirements
Extract ALL prerequisites and dependencies

### 2. Safety First
Always document what NOT to do
Include STOP conditions and escalation triggers

### 3. Validation Everywhere
Every change needs verification steps
Document how to confirm success

### 4. Time-Box Everything
Provide time estimates for each procedure
Include timeout conditions

### 5. Role-Based Documentation
Clearly mark junior-safe vs senior-required
Progressive complexity levels

## The Anti-Patterns We Avoid

### Coverage Vanity Metrics
❌ "We have 95% documentation coverage"
✅ "We have 80% maintenance readiness"

### Feature Documentation
❌ "This function does X"
✅ "To maintain X, do these steps"

### Abstract Quality Scores
❌ "Code quality: B+"
✅ "Daily maintenance: 8/10 ready"

### Crisis-Focused Documentation
❌ "When production is down..."
✅ "During weekly maintenance window..."

## The New Success Metrics

### Operational Excellence
- Maintenance windows meet SLA: 95%
- Junior engineer independence: 75%
- Error rate during maintenance: <2%
- Audit prep time: <2 hours
- Escalation rate: <10%

### Documentation Quality
- Daily procedures documented: 80%
- Weekly procedures documented: 70%
- Monthly procedures documented: 60%
- All procedures have validation steps: 100%
- All procedures have rollback plans: 100%

## The Ultimate Test

**Can a junior engineer perform routine maintenance safely using only our generated documentation?**

If yes, we've succeeded.
If no, we have more work to do.

This is the new DDD way: Maintenance-First, Always.

# DAYLIGHT Documentation Coverage Specification v1.0
**Documentation Driven Development (DDD) for DAYLIGHT Framework**

## Overview

This specification defines **what constitutes complete documentation** for each DAYLIGHT dimension and how to measure coverage. It's the documentation equivalent of test specifications in TDD.

## Core Principle: The Three-Level Coverage Model

```
Level 1: Element Coverage → "Does it exist?"
Level 2: Completeness Coverage → "Are required fields present?"  
Level 3: Usefulness Coverage → "Can someone use this at 2AM?"
```

## Coverage Requirements by Dimension

### Dependencies (D) - Target: 90% Coverage

#### Required Elements (Level 1)
```yaml
required_elements:
  - runtime_dependencies     # Must document all production deps
  - development_dependencies  # Must document all dev deps
  - peer_dependencies        # Must document all peer deps
  - node_version             # Must specify Node.js version
  - package_manager          # Must identify npm/yarn/pnpm
  - lock_file                # Must have lock file present

element_coverage_formula: found_elements / required_elements
```

#### Required Fields per Element (Level 2)
```yaml
dependency_fields:
  required:
    - name                  # Package name
    - version               # Version constraint
    - purpose              # Why is this needed?
    - failure_impact       # What breaks without it?
  optional:
    - alternatives         # Can it be replaced?
    - security_status      # Known vulnerabilities?
    - last_updated         # When was it last updated?

completeness_formula: (required_fields * 0.8) + (optional_fields * 0.2)
```

#### Usefulness Criteria (Level 3)
```yaml
usefulness_tests:
  - can_identify_missing_dependency: "Error message → which package?"
  - can_determine_version_compatibility: "Version conflict → resolution?"
  - can_assess_security_risk: "Vulnerability → severity and fix?"
  - can_perform_recovery: "Dependency failure → recovery steps?"

usefulness_score: passed_tests / total_tests
```

### Automation (A) - Target: 85% Coverage

#### Required Elements
```yaml
required_elements:
  - npm_scripts            # All package.json scripts

    - failure_handling    # What if it fails?
  optional:
    - dependencies        # What must run first?

## Coverage Calculation Formula

### Overall Documentation Coverage
```python
def calculate_documentation_coverage(extracted_docs):
    """
    Calculate overall documentation coverage score.
    This is what we measure instead of code coverage.
    """
    dimension_scores = {}
    
    for dimension in DAYLIGHT_DIMENSIONS:
        # Level 1: Element Coverage
        element_coverage = calculate_element_coverage(
            extracted_docs[dimension],
            REQUIRED_ELEMENTS[dimension]
        )
        
        # Level 2: Completeness Coverage
        completeness_coverage = calculate_completeness_coverage(
            extracted_docs[dimension],
            REQUIRED_FIELDS[dimension]
        )
        
        # Level 3: Usefulness Coverage
        usefulness_coverage = calculate_usefulness_coverage(
            extracted_docs[dimension],
            USEFULNESS_TESTS[dimension]
        )
        
        # Weighted average for dimension
        dimension_scores[dimension] = (
            element_coverage * 0.3 +
            completeness_coverage * 0.4 +
            usefulness_coverage * 0.3
        )
    
    # Overall coverage with dimension weights
    overall_coverage = sum(
        dimension_scores[d] * DIMENSION_WEIGHTS[d]
        for d in DAYLIGHT_DIMENSIONS
    )
    
    return {
        'overall': overall_coverage,
        'dimensions': dimension_scores,
        'passed': overall_coverage >= MINIMUM_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD
    }
```

### Dimension Weights
```python
DIMENSION_WEIGHTS = {
    'dependencies': 0.15,    # Critical for troubleshooting
    'automation': 0.12,      # Important for operations
    'yearbook': 0.08,        # Historical context
    'lifecycle': 0.13,       # Deployment critical
    'integration': 0.15,     # External dependencies
    'governance': 0.10,      # Compliance needs
    'health': 0.12,          # Monitoring critical
    'testing': 0.15          # Quality assurance
}
# Total: 1.00
```

## Coverage Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Coverage
```yaml
production_ready:
  overall: 85%
  critical_dimensions:  # Must all be above threshold
    - dependencies: 90%
    - integration: 90%
    - testing: 85%

mvp_ready:
  overall: 70%
  critical_dimensions:
    - dependencies: 80%
    - automation: 75%

development:
  overall: 50%
  no_dimension_below: 30%
```

## DDD Workflow Implementation

### 1. RED Phase: Write Coverage Spec
```python
# Define what complete documentation looks like
coverage_spec = DAYLIGHTCoverageSpec(
    dimension="dependencies",
    required_elements=["runtime_deps", "node_version", "lock_file"],
    required_fields=["name", "version", "failure_impact"],
    minimum_coverage=0.90
)
```

### 2. Measure Coverage (Fails Initially)
```python
# Extract documentation from codebase
extracted_docs = daylight_extractor.extract(project_path)

# Measure against spec
coverage = measure_coverage(extracted_docs, coverage_spec)
assert coverage >= 0.90  # FAILS! Only 45% coverage initially
```

### 3. GREEN Phase: Improve Extractors
```python
# Enhance extractors to find more information
def enhanced_dependency_extractor(project_path):
    # Add extraction for missing elements
    deps = extract_package_json(project_path)
    deps.update(extract_lock_file(project_path))
    deps.update(extract_node_version(project_path))
    deps.update(infer_failure_impacts(deps))
    return deps
```

### 4. REFACTOR Phase: Optimize Documentation
```python
# Refactor for better organization and clarity
def optimize_documentation(docs):
    docs = group_by_criticality(docs)
    docs = add_troubleshooting_guides(docs)
    docs = generate_dependency_matrix(docs)
    return docs
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Documentation Coverage Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  doc-coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Extract Documentation
        run: python daylight_extractor.py . --output extracted-docs.json
      
      - name: Measure Documentation Coverage
        run: python measure_coverage.py extracted-docs.json --spec daylight-spec.yaml
      
      - name: Generate Coverage Report
        run: python coverage_report.py --format html --output coverage-report.html
      
      - name: Fail if Below Threshold
        run: |
          COVERAGE=$(cat coverage.json | jq '.overall')
          if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 0.85" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "❌ Documentation coverage too low: ${COVERAGE}%"
            echo "Required: 85%"
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "✅ Documentation coverage passed: ${COVERAGE}%"
      
      - name: Upload Coverage Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: documentation-coverage-report
          path: coverage-report.html
```

<h1>DAYLIGHT Documentation Coverage Report</h1>

<div class="coverage-summary">
  <div class="overall-score">87.5%</div>
  <div class="status passed">PASSED</div>
</div>

<div class="dimension-breakdown">
  <h2>Coverage by Dimension</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Dimension</th>
      <th>Coverage</th>
      <th>Target</th>
      <th>Status</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dependencies</td>
      <td>92%</td>
      <td>90%</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <!-- ... -->
  </table>
</div>

<div class="missing-documentation">
  <h2>Missing Documentation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Git hooks documentation</li>
    <li>Redis failure recovery</li>
    <li>Deploy script error handling</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Success Metrics

### Documentation Coverage vs Code Coverage
```
Code Coverage asks: "Did we test this code?"
Documentation Coverage asks: "Can someone maintain this system?"

Code Coverage: 90% lines executed
Documentation Coverage: 90% maintenance scenarios documented
```

### Business Value
- **Before DDD**: 45% of incidents require escalation due to missing docs
- **After DDD**: 10% of incidents require escalation
- **ROI**: 35% reduction in MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)

## Conclusion

Documentation Coverage provides the missing metric for documentation quality. By treating documentation specifications like test specifications, we can:

1. **Define** what complete documentation looks like
2. **Measure** current documentation against the spec
3. **Improve** extractors until coverage meets targets
4. **Maintain** quality through CI/CD enforcement

This creates a virtuous cycle where documentation quality continuously improves, just as code quality improves through TDD.

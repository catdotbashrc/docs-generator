# DDD Framework Documentation

## Quick Links

- **[User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md)** - Getting started and CLI usage
- **[API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md)** - Complete API documentation
- **[DAYLIGHT Specification](DAYLIGHT_SPECIFICATION.md)** - The 8 dimensions of documentation coverage
- **[Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Contributing and creating extractors

## What is DDD?

Documentation Driven Development applies Test-Driven Development principles to documentation. Just as TDD ensures code quality through tests, DDD ensures maintenance readiness through measurable documentation coverage.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv pip install -e .

# Measure coverage
ddd measure ./my-project

# Assert in CI/CD
ddd assert-coverage ./my-project --threshold 0.85
```

## The Problem We Solve

At 2AM during an incident, ops teams need answers:
- What IAM permissions does this need?
- What can go wrong?
- How do I know if it's working?
- What does this depend on?

DDD automatically extracts this information and measures completeness.
